This is a very interesting dataset where we can see the Data Scientists salary based on the years of experience they have, various cities, skills etc. However, the dataset is slightly older and published in Dec'18 i.e. pre-covid era. So current statistics might vary to some extent. But it is definitely relatable and we will find some lead. 
During the analysis I found that the city Bangalore is the hottest city for Data Scientists, followed by Mumbai & Gurgaon.
Freshers with 0-1 years of experience get a minimum CTC of 0 to maximum 10LPA.
Whereas the CTC range of 25-60LPA are mostly filled by the employees having 8 years of experinece.
In case of skills, analytical skills, communication skills are shown to be important.
I made an LightGBMRegressor model with MSE as the error metric.
